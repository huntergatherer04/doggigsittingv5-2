# Dog Sitting Landing Page (Version 5)

This is my simple one-screen landing page for my pet & house sitting service.

- Built as a practice project to learn the GitHub → Vercel workflow  
- No frameworks — just `index.html`, `style.css`, `robots.txt`, and an `images/` folder  
- Private by design (robots.txt blocks indexing)  
- Color palette: deep navy + sand + warm neutrals  
- Calls to action: Call or Text only  

### Deployment
The site is deployed through Vercel using the “Other” framework preset with no build step.

### Next steps
Rewrite the text in my own voice and finalize the layout.
